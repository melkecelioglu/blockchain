# blockchain



White walkers stalking you in the night? Death eaters knocking down your door?

Well, sounds like you‚Äôre looking to build a blockchain and cryptocurrency! Having your own blockchain and cryptocurrency is the number one way to get rid of threats both magical and technical!

Ok, maybe the magic part was a tiny bit exaggerated. But the technical part, not so much! The blockchain has become a magic bullet in the software world throughout the past few years. It‚Äôs proven that it has the power to revolutionize economic systems and so much more. It seems to have the power to save us all. But the blockchain wave has only begun! There is so much untapped potential in the field for high-paying employment, and new exciting companies. But it all starts with building a blockchain and cryptocurrency? How are you going to do that? Take a look at this!

‚ÄºÔ∏è UPGRADE


Implemented the proof of work system by adding a difficulty and nonce value to each block.

Adjusted the difficulty for a block to ensure that blocks are mined at a rate which approaches a set mining rate for the system.

Investigated the proof of work system by writing a script which checked how will the dynamic difficulty adjusted the system to approach the mine rate.

Switched the hexadecimal character-based difficulty criteria to a more fine-grained binary bit-based difficulty criteria.

Prevented a potential difficulty jump attack by adding extra validation for the blockchain.


NEXT - API AND NETWORK! ü¶æ

‚ÄºÔ∏è UPGRADE


Here‚Äôs what have been done in three days;

Set up an express API to allow for interaction to the backend through HTTP requests.

Created a GET request to read the blockchain.

Added a POST request to write new blocks to the blockchain.

Implemented a real-time messaging network through Redis or PubNub.

Added the ability to broadcast chains.

Started peers through alternate ports, and broadcasted chains when blocks were mined through the api.

Synchronized chains when new peers connected to the network.

Optimized the implementation to avoid redundant interaction.

NEXT - WALLETS, KEYS AND TRANSACTIONS! ü¶æ 

(i probably have to rest for a few days because of I will have a lot thing to do for family see u soon! )


September the 1st, ‚ÄºÔ∏èUPDATE

The overall project is getting pretty advanced! A whole backend blockchain, and now a bunch of initial objects for a cryptocurrency. Plus, everything is validated by tests. Pretty cool!



Completing this section is an achievement to be proud of myself. Here‚Äôs what i built:

-- Created the core wallet class for the cryptocurrency.

-- Developed the cryptographic key pair and public key addressing system.

-- Implementing signature generation and verification to make transactions official.

-- Built the main transaction class - with the output map and input structure.

-- Developed functionality to actually validate transactions.

-- Tied transaction creation with the wallet class.

-- Allowed transactions to be updated with multiple outputs to efficiently use existing objects.

-- Improved the hash function to recognize objects with new properties as changes in incoming data.

-- Covered edges cases with transaction updates to prevent vulnerabilities.



NEXT- TRANSACTION POOL! ü¶æ
